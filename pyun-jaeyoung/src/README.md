# 재의 Plan

#### Essential things that you'll learn in this course:
- Setting up your coding environment
- Syntax
- Surface Knowledge (DS&A)
- Logic
- Git 
- External Modules
- Building your own product from ground up (note: you're going to be the person who generates this idea; i don't plan on standing in the way of creativity)

#### **NOTE**: This lesson isn’t taught by theory; it’s taught by doing. If you have a problem with this, you’d be better off learning at https://codecademy.com, https://theodinproject.com, or https://exercism.com 

#### Brief Overview
This should take around 1 week per module, assuming that you have schoolwork on top of this. This requires probably a hour worth of work everyday and will work your brain. its worth it tho fr

**This is NOT an entire Python course**, rather an introductory course. Having this boilerplate will set you up for learning everything later in the future, and is on the same level as college-level courses. I'm just compressing it and getting only the crucial work that pertains to computer science in general.

Before everything, your coding environment will be set up first. Check ``src/pre`` to see how to set this up. Everything is completely subjective in this matter.

Logic will be first on the list; this is the essentials of computer science and is probably the toughest one to get over (subjectively). Logic is probably one of the best things you'll learn about computer science because it pertains to almost everything in the universe and will make a lot of things easier for you to understand; it's a shame that you can only learn this in college.

Syntax will be the second on the list; this includes learning keywords in Python, understanding what does what and how Python syntax is like and how it relates to other languages such as C/C++, JavaScript, and much more. 

Surface knowledge will come after. This entails shit like data structures, the essences of those structures, and how logic works within those. This is tough, but I'll make it easy.

External modules will come next; this entails stuff outside of vanilla Python like math-related, web-development related, and game development-related. I'll only teach you how to install, use, and understand how to use these modules, but it's up to you individually to fully comprehend what those modules entail.

Git is last on the learning list: your sister & I probably use Git everyday in our life while working, and it's one of the essences of how files get onto the web. This controls workflow; I'll be teaching you this in a compressed format, teaching only what's necessary (saving, uploading, branching, cherry-picking, cloning, some more i forgot..). You can ask your sister about this if you'd like.

Building your own product from ground up is our final project. I will not be holding your hand throughout this project, but I'll set you up with an outline to start. Everything that I've taught you should culminate to this very product. 

Let's start!
